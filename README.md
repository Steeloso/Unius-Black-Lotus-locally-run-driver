Made this just to be sure that if unius stopped supporting the black lotus, i'd have the driver saved (and be able to actually change something)

If you plan on building it yourself, install npm on the root directory

Also, if you'd prefer to run the web page locally, instead of using the app. Download the "BlackLotus" folder, and host it by using for example python (python -m http.server 'port' (default is 8000 iirc), then go to your browser and put localhost:'port') on the folder
(to be clear, you are to switch 'port' with the port you prefer to use)
